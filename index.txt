I'am a new student of Fall 2019 batch in Northwest Missouri State University.

I was born and raised in Hyderabad, India. I had completed my under-graduation course in 2018 in the field of  Computer science.
So, being a computer science student i have explored many technologies during my under-graduate course where i gained some practical experience.
I have a great interest in web technologies and especially on server-side programming like Node js and Php.
 Currently i' am learning javascript and i hope this subject helps to gain some hands on experience in web development and helps to reach my career goal.

I would like to make full use of this course to  achieve my goal as a web developer.
